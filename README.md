This project implements an AI Agent automation workflow built on the n8n platform.
The workflow is triggered by a "Chat Message Received" event, which passes the user's query to an AI Agent. The agent is integrated with three critical components:
 * Google Gemini Chat Model: Provides advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities.
 * Simple Window Memory: Allows the agent to retain conversation history for multi-turn interactions.
 * SerpAPI (Google Search Tool): Empowers the agent with real-time web access to fetch up-to-date information beyond its training data.
This solution demonstrates a production-ready AI assistant capable of automating information retrieval and providing intelligent, real-time responses through a seamless, low-code architecture
